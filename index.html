                    This post aims to support our work on selection bias in the context
                    of news coverage. The paper can be found <a>here [TODO]</a>. We present the motivation
                    for the project, and an interactive data visualisation of the learned relationships
                    between news sources.

                <h4>Abstract</h4>
                <p>
                    The world’s events are no longer reported through a daily condensate,
                    rather a continuous stream of events, dispatched by the world’s largest
                    media organizations. From local news to global headlines, the event space
                    is much too large to be treated exhaustively: news entities have to select
                    and filter the coverage they broadcast through their respective channels.
                    The subjective nature of this filtering induces biases due to, among other
                    things, resource constraints, editorial guidelines, ideological affinities,
                    or even the fragmented nature of the information at a journalist’s disposal.
                    The magnitude and direction of this bias are, however, widely unknown.
                    The absence of ground truth, the sheer size of the event space, or the lack
                    of an exhaustive set of absolute features to measure makes it diffcult to observe
                    the bias directly, to characterize the leaning’s nature and to factor it out to
                    ensure a neutral coverage of the news.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this work, we introduce a methodology to capture the latent structure of media’s
                     decision process at a large scale. Our contribution is multi-fold. First, we show
                     media coverage to be predictable using personalization techniques, and evaluate
                     our approach on a large set of events collected from the GDELT database. We then
                     show that a personalized and parametrized approach not only exhibits higher accuracy
                     in coverage prediction, but also provides an interpretable representation of the
                     selection bias. Last, we propose a method able to select a set of sources by
                     leveraging the latent representation. These selected sources provide a more diverse
                     and egalitarian coverage, all while retaining the most actively covered events.

                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p>
                    The fundamental role of news is to spread information about events
                    occurring across the globe to individuals who want or need to stay
                    informed about the current state of world affairs. These events happen
                    on a variety of different scales, from global to highly local, and all
                    across the planet. To get a grasp on the world’s state, even avid readers
                    must pre-process the event space, with such sampling inherently exposing
                    them to a distorted perspective. This processing is a conscious selection
                    which not only applies to the final consumer (the reader) but also to the
                    provider: news sources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    News organizations are designed to be the initial filter of the event stream,
                     pruning, condensing and categorizing it into manageable chunks of information.
                     Unfortunately, it is difficult to guarantee the neutrality of this selection:
                     the process is performed by the editorial team based on an arbitrary number of
                     factors. Some of them are obvious, such as geographic considerations, editorial
                     guidelines, thematic regards or even logistic capabilities. Others are not visible
                     at a glance: ideological leanings or higher order structures such as broadcast
                     syndications or corporate structures. Either one of these can compromise the
                     representativity of the news sample presented: this is generally referred to as
                     <i>gatekeeping</i> or <i>selection bias</i>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Any attempt to measure the influence of these factors on news coverage in absolute
                    terms is ill-fated: the factor space could never claim to be exhaustive, and a
                    subset would be at best arbitrary. Additionally, these measures suffer from the
                    absence of baselines: they are all relative estimates, having no ground truth to
                    compare to. These issues are substantial barriers to the interpretability of biases
                    in the coverage of news, which can have a very real impact on the readers’ world
                    views <sup><a href='#fn2' id='ref2'>2</a></sup>. The concentration of media ownership also contributes to reinforcing these
                    biases, since consolidating coverage mechanically weakens media pluralism. The lack of
                    accountability in these issues is an obvious threat to broadcasting diversity and could
                    jeopardize media integrity, aggravating the public’s lack of con dence in news sources <sup><a href='#fn3' id='ref3'>3</a></sup>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In this work, we establish a methodology to identify and characterize bias
                    in the mainstream media landscape by recognizing it as a manifestation of
                    the selection process performed by a news source. This paves the way for its
                    treatment as a preference problem, well suited to approaches inspired by
                    personalization methods.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We first argue that capturing this bias would require comparing distributions
                    of covered events across news sources, as a biased selection of stories from a
                    news media cannot be observed by looking at the source alone. We thus intend to
                    measure by how much a specific source’s news selection deviates from another by
                    learning a latent representation of this source’s preferences from its observed
                    selection of events. We hypothesize that this representation allows the study of
                    relationships between sources, and sheds light on the factors that guide their
                    decisions. Last, we claim that this representation could be used to reduce the selection
                    bias, proposing a method to promote diversity and equality in the coverage of events
                    by selecting a representative subset of sources.
                </p>

                <h4>Data</h4>
                <p>
                    Recent initiatives, such as the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone
                    (GDELT <sup><a href='#fn4' id='ref4'>4</a></sup>) and
                    EventRegistry <sup><a href='#fn5' id='ref5'>5</a></sup>, aim to collect,
                    store and process news from all around the world. They have attracted increasing
                    academic attention due to their scale and their temporal coverage. Those
                    initiatives thus represent a unique opportunity to study the speci cities
                    of the selection process on a large set of news sources. Specifically,
                    GDELT is a publicly available catalog of worldwide activities. It actively
                    monitors a wide range of news sources (broadcast, print and web), recording
                    and annotating global events and their coverage. In this study we extract the
                    necessary data from the GDELT 2.0 Event Database <sup><a href='#fn6' id='ref6'>6</a></sup>:
                    the events table and the mentions table provided by GDELT v2.
                    GDELT events are annotated with the Tabari system <sup><a href='#fn7' id='ref7'>7</a></sup>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The events table references the coverage of events (sampled every 15 minutes) by
                    the sources denoted in the mentions table. The set is then annotated with a best-effort
                    metadata completion, trying to assign actors, geographical codes, even sentiment scores
                    and categorizing the type of event. Importantly, it assigns a globally unique identifier
                    to each event, which allows continuous tracking of this events’ coverage across time and sources.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The learning part of our analysis only required to build the interaction matrix between sources
                    and events: we scrape the events and mentions tables to recover which events were covered by
                    which sources in a given timespan. We filter low-count events and sources (sources that have
                    covered less than 5 events, and conversely events covered by less than 5 sources) to limit the
                    impact of the cold-start problem.
